// Here you're initializing NextAuth.js with the authConfig object and exporting the 
// auth property. You're also using the matcher option from Middleware to specify that 
// it should run on specific paths.

// The advantage of employing Middleware for this task is that the protected routes will 
// not even start rendering until the Middleware verifies the authentication, enhancing 
// both the security and performance of your application.
